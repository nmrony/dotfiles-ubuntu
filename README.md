Nur Rony's Dotfiles
===================
My dotfiles :smile: for Zsh on **MacOS**. Clone the repository and Run `setup.sh` to setup some initial requirements 

My most favourite parts are `.functions` and `.dockerfunctions`

### Customization
Do not forget to edit git username and email in `.extra` and `.gitconfig` with yours.

**Happy Hacking!!**

### Developers macOS defaults (?) :wink:

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:
```sh
./.macos
```
###Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common Homebrew formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):
```sh
./brew.sh
```
